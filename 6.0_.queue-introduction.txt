    What is a Queue?
        A queue is a linear data structure which models real world queues by 
            having two primary operations, namely enqueue and dequeue.
          
          Dequeue    Queue Back    
             |           |
            0 <- 0 0 0 0 0 <- 0
                 |           |
          Queue Front     Enqueue

    Queue Terminology
        There does not seem to be consistent terminology for inserting and removing
            elements from queues.

            Enqueue = Adding = Offering

            Dequeue = Polling
            (These are also sometimes called removing, 
            but I find this ambiguous)

    Queue example
    1)  Instructions:
            Enqueue(12)
            Dequeue()
            Dequeue()
            Enqueue(7)
            Dequeue()
            Enqueue(-6)
        Front -> 55 -1 33 17 11 <- Back

    2)  Instructions:
            Enqueue(12) <-
            Dequeue()
            Dequeue()
            Enqueue(7)
            Dequeue()
            Enqueue(-6)
        Front -> 55 -1 33 17 11 12 <- Back

    3)  Instructions:
            Enqueue(12) 
            Dequeue() <-
            Dequeue()
            Enqueue(7)
            Dequeue()
            Enqueue(-6)
        Front -> -1 33 17 11 12 <- Back

    4)  Instructions:
            Enqueue(12) 
            Dequeue()
            Dequeue() <-
            Enqueue(7)
            Dequeue()
            Enqueue(-6)
        Front -> 33 17 11 12 <- Back

    5)  Instructions:
            Enqueue(12) 
            Dequeue()
            Dequeue()
            Enqueue(7) <-
            Dequeue()
            Enqueue(-6)
        Front -> 33 17 11 12 7 <- Back

    6)  Instructions:
            Enqueue(12) 
            Dequeue()
            Dequeue()
            Enqueue(7)
            Dequeue() <-
            Enqueue(-6)
        Front -> 17 11 12 <- Back

    7)  Instructions:
            Enqueue(12) 
            Dequeue()
            Dequeue()
            Enqueue(7)
            Dequeue() 
            Enqueue(-6) <-
        Front -> 17 11 12 -6 <- Back


    When and where is a Queue used?
        - Any waiting line models a queue, for example a lineup at a movie theatre.
        - Can be used to effeiciently keep track of the x most recently added
            elements
        - Web server request management where you want first come first serve.
        - Breadth first search (BFS) graph traversal.

    
    Complexity Analysis
        Enqueue     0(1)
        Dequeue     0(1)
        Peeking     0(1)
       Contains     0(n)
        Removal     0(n)
       Is Empty     0(1)
