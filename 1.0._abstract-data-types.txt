What is a Data Structure?
    A data structure(DS) is a way of organizing data so that it can be used
    effectively.

Why Data Structures?
    They are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms.
    They help to manage and organize data.
    They make code cleaner and easier to understand.



Abstract Data Types vs. Data Structures

Abstract Data Types 
    An abstract data type(ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides
    only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.

    The interface does not give any specific details about how something should
    be implemented or in what programming language. 

Examples
    Abstraction(ADT)  |  Implemtation(DS)
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    List              |  Dynamic Array Linked List
    
    Queue             |  Linked List based Queue
                      |  Array based Queue
                      |  Stack based Queue
    
    Map               |  Tree Map
                      |  Hash Map/Hash Table
    
    Vehicle           |  Golf Cart 
                      |  Bicycle
                      |  Smart Car
