What is a static Array?
    A static array is fixed length container containing n elements indexable
    from the range [0, n-1].

    Q: What is meant by being 'indexable'?
    A: This means that each slot/index in the array can be referenced 
    with a number.


When and Where is a static Array used?
    1) Storing and accessing sequential data
    2) Temporatily storing objects
    3) Used by IO routines as buffers
    4) Lookup tables and inverse lookup tables
    5) Can be used to return multiple values from a function
    6) Used i dynamic programming to cache answers to subproblems

Static Array
        A = 44 12 -5 17 6 0 3 9 100
    Index = 0  1  2  3  4 5 6 7  8  

    A[0] = 44
    A[1] = 12
    A[2] = 6
    A[3] = 9
    A[9] => index out of bounds!

    Elements in A are referenced by their index. There is no other way to access 
    elements in an array. Array indexing is zero-based, meaning the first element 
    is found in position zero.


Dynamic Array 
    The dynamic array can grow and shrink in size.

                A = 34 4
    A.add(-7)   A = 34 4 -7
    A.add(34)   A = 34 4 -7 34
  A.remove(4)   A = 34 -7 34

    Q: How can we implement a dynamic array?
        A: One way is to use a static array!
    
    1) Create a static array with an initial capacity.

    2) Add elements to the underlying static array, keeping track of the 
        number of elements.

    3) If adding another element will exceed the capacity, then create a new
        static array with twice the capacity and copy the original elements
        into it.

    Suppose we create a dynamic array with an initial capacity of two and then
        begin adding elements to it.
